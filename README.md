Making the UK register of data controllers more useable


### Why are we doing this in the first place?


### How data has changed since the ICO's format was updated?

The new format of the register has no differentiation about whether they collect data about their own staff, and they customers or ANY stakeholders.

Previous versions at least showed which apply kinds of data collection apply to each stakeholder.

_At present, the website shows both, as not every org registered after the change in how data was captured_

###Â Licensing?

Both versions are open government licenses

### Privacy considerations?
